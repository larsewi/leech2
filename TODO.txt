# TODO

## Add SQL date / time column type to table config

## Strip delete subsidary values in consolidated deltas (to reduce size)

## Configure compression (due to CPU concerns)
- Configure on/ off
- Configure compression level

## Truncate history
- Configurable through config
- Orphaned blocks should always be removed
- One stratergy to remove every block already reported to hub
- One stratgery to remove every block after N blocks in the chain
- One stratergy to remove based on date / time (e.g., older then 1 week)
- The history is truncated on every new commit
- Add acceptance tests for orphaned blocks, plus different stratergies

## Support JSON config files
- Format detected based on file ending .toml / .json

## Add acceptance test for when state is smaller than delta
