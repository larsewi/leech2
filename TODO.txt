# TODO

## Truncate history
- Configurable through config
- Orphaned blocks should always be removed
- One stratergy to remove every block already reported to hub
- One stratgery to remove every block after N blocks in the chain
- One stratergy to remove based on date / time (e.g., older then 1 week)
- The history is truncated on every new commit
- Add acceptance tests for orphaned blocks, plus different stratergies

## Make the README more readable for someone who has never heard of leech2
